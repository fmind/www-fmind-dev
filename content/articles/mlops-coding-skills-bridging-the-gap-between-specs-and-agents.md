We are entering the golden age of AI Coding. Every day, I see colleagues, both technical and non-technical, marveling at how agents are rewriting the rules of software construction. The promise is intoxicating: describe what you want, and let the machine handle the rest.

However, when I see my colleagues try to apply these agents to strict engineering standards, they hit a wall. On one side, you have rigorous specification tools like [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) or [conductor](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor). They are deterministic and thorough, but setting them up feels like writing a legal contract. On the other side, you have generic tools like the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. They act as incredible “hands” for the AI — reading databases, calling APIs — but they lack the _brain_ for your specific context.

They don’t know that your team enforces [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) over [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). They don’t know you prefer [just](https://github.com/casey/just) files for automation. They don’t know your specific flavor of “clean code.”

Then I discovered [**Agent Skills**](https://agentskills.io/home), and everything clicked.

I was immediately hooked. They offer the specific trade-off I had been looking for: **lightweight enough to be flexible, yet opinionated enough to be useful.**

In this article, I want to share how I used Agent Skills to turn the theoretical “MLOps Coding Course” into a practical, actionable library: the [**MLOps Coding Skills**](https://github.com/MLOps-Courses/mlops-coding-skills) project.

### The Challenge: Making References Actionable

For the past few months, I’ve been deep in the trenches writing the [**MLOps Coding Course**](https://github.com/MLOps-Courses/mlops-coding-course). It is a comprehensive curriculum teaching production-grade MLOps, from robust project initialization to advanced observability.

But as I wrote the documentation, I felt a friction point. Learning the standards is one thing; remembering to apply them in the heat of coding is another.

I didn’t just want another wiki page. I wanted to make these best practices **actionable** for valid AI Agents. I wanted to move from “reading the docs” to “installing the capability.”

### The Logic: How to “Skillify” Knowledge

The beauty of an Agent Skill lies in its simplicity. It is essentially a markdown file (`SKILL.md`) that functions as a context injection module. It gives the agent “muscle memory” for a specific topic.

My methodology for building the **MLOps Coding Skills** repo was straightforward:

1. **Isolate a Chapter**: Take a specific section of the course (e.g., _Automation_ or _Observability_).
2. **Extract Patterns**: Use an LLM to distill the generic engineering standards from the educational content.
3. **Standardize**: Format it into a `SKILL.md` that an agent can ingest.

### A Concrete Example: Automating Ops

Let’s look at the [**mlops-automation**](https://github.com/MLOps-Courses/mlops-coding-skills/tree/main/mlops-automation) skill.

In our course, we have strong opinions: we use `just` for command running and [docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization, with very specific layer caching strategies.

Here is what the skill looks like “on the wire”:

```markdown
# MLOps Automation

## Goal

To elevate the codebase to production standards by adding Task Automation (just), Containerization ([docker](https://www.docker.com/)), CI/CD ([github-actions](https://github.com/features/actions)), and Experiment Tracking ([mlflow](https://mlflow.org/)).

## Instructions

### 1. Task Automation

Replace manual commands with a `justfile`.

1. **Tool**: `just` (modern alternative to Make).
2. **Organization**: Split tasks into `tasks/*.just` modules.
3. **Core Tasks**:
   - `check`: Run all linters and tests.
   - `package`: Build wheels.

### 2. Containerization

1. **Tool**: `docker`.
2. **Base Image**: Use `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.1X-bookworm-slim` for minimal size.
```

When I load this skill, my agent stops guessing. It doesn’t offer me a Makefile. It doesn’t suggest a bloated Ubuntu image. It acts like a senior engineer who has been on the team for years.

### The “Senior Engineer” Injection

This is the killer value proposition.

Most frustrations with AI coding come from a **lack of context**. We blame the model for being “dumb,” but usually, we just haven’t told it the rules of the house.

By using Agent Skills, you are effectively **injecting a Senior Engineer into your chat context**. You are giving the agent a “cheat sheet” that forces it to align with your organization’s reality.

I now use these skills for every new project I touch. I don’t spend an hour setting up boilerplate. I load or create a skill, and within minutes, I had a structure that matched my most rigorous standards.

### The Friction Points

Of course, no solution is perfect. There are still rough edges in this workflow:

- **Local-First Friction**: Currently, skills often sit in a local `.agent/skills` folder. It works, but copying them around feels archaic.
- **The Context Stack**: We are seeing a fragmentation of context. We have MCP servers for tools, `AGENTS.md` for persona, and Skills for tasks. Managing this “Context Stack” is becoming a new engineering discipline.
- **Integration gaps**: I love how the **Gemini CLI** handles this via extensions, but I’m eager to see this standardized across VS Code Copilot, Cursor, and other IDEs.

### Conclusion

Despite the minor friction, Agent Skills are excellent “Low Hanging Fruit” for any engineering team.

The productivity gain is massive. For a few minutes of setup — writing a markdown file — you save hours of correcting boilerplate code and enforcing standards down the line. It bridges the gap between the **rigidity of a spec** and the **chaos of a raw LLM**.

If you are tired of fighting your AI to follow your style, stop arguing with it. Give it a Skill.
