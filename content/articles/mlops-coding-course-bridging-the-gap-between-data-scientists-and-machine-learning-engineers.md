As a Freelance MLOps Engineer working for [Decathlon Digital](https://digital.decathlon.net/), I’ve witnessed firsthand the growing need for data scientists to transition into machine learning engineers. The increasing complexity of AI/ML projects demands more than just modeling skills; it requires a deep understanding of software development practices to ensure that models can be deployed, scaled, and maintained effectively in production environments.

This observation sparked the creation of the [**MLOps Coding Course**](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/), an open-source course specifically designed to bridge the gap between data science and software engineering. It’s a comprehensive guide that offers practical knowledge and tools to build, deploy, and manage production-ready AI/ML systems.

### Why Coding Skills Are Essential for MLOps

The course emphasizes **coding best practices** because they are fundamental for building robust and maintainable MLOps systems. Strong coding skills enable ML engineers to:

- **Structure code effectively:** Organizing code into packages, modules, and functions promotes modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance.
- **Implement robust validation:** Applying techniques like typing, linting, and testing ensures code quality, reduces errors, and facilitates collaboration.
- **Automate tasks efficiently:** Scripting common tasks with tools like [PyInvoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) streamlines workflows, saving time and reducing manual effort.
- **Manage dependencies effectively:** Utilizing tools like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) simplifies the management of dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.
- **Build reproducible environments:** Leveraging containers with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ensures consistent deployment environments, mitigating “it works on my machine” issues.

### Course Highlights

The [**MLOps Coding Course**](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/) aims at establishing a solid foundation. You will learn how to [**set up your system and installing necessary tools**](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/1.%20Initializing/index.html) such as [Python](https://python.org/), [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The course then dive into [**prototyping with Jupyter Notebooks**](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/2.%20Prototyping/index.html), where we cover best practices for managing [imports](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/2.%20Prototyping/2.1.%20Imports.html), [configurations](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/2.%20Prototyping/2.2.%20Configs.html), [datasets](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/2.%20Prototyping/2.3.%20Datasets.html), [analysis](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/2.%20Prototyping/2.4.%20Analysis.html), [modeling](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/2.%20Prototyping/2.5.%20Modeling.html), and [evaluation](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/2.%20Prototyping/2.6.%20Evaluations.html).

The course then moves on to [**productionization**](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/3.%20Productionizing/index.html), guiding you on how to structure code into proper Python [packages](https://mlops-coding-course.fmind.dev/3.%20Productionizing/3.0.%20Package.html).
